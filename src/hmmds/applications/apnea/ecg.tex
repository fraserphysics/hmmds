\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

I wrote explore.py to see how processing ECGs for apnea detection was
working.  Because I was disappointed by the performance of standard qrs
detectors that I got from
https://github.com/berndporr/py-ecg-detectors, I wrote my own by
building HMMs for ECG time series.

Recipes for making the models and figures described here appear in
Rules.mk.

\section{Outliers}
\label{sec:outliers}

While most of the ECG data consists of oscillations with amplitudes
less than $\pm$ 2mV, some intervals have spurious signals with $\pm$
10mV.  I call such signals \emph{lead noise}\footnote{The data in
  record \emph{C01} is less than .1mV till minute 5.1 when it goes to
  10 mV.  The usable data only starts at minute 10.24.}.  A model,
$\theta$, fit to the typical data can assign $P(y|\theta) = 0$ to lead
noise.  The observation models use inverse gamma priors for the
variance, and I use a single state, which I call the \emph{bad} state,
with prior that enforces a large variance to accommodate lead noise.
In particular the parameters are $\alpha=10^{8}$ and $\beta=10^{20}$
which in the reestimation formula
\begin{equation*}
  \sigma^2 = \frac{2 \beta + \text{data}}{2 \alpha +2 + \text{weight}}
\end{equation*}
gives $\sigma^2 \approx 10^{12}$ if there is not much data.  I arrived
at those values by trial and error.

Since lead noise can start abruptly at any time, I allow transitions
between the bad state and every other state.  It's important to ensure
that those transitions are infrequent.  The high variance makes the
likelihood for the bad state small.

\section{A Monotonic Model with 21 States}
\label{sec:mono20}

I've built HMMs with 20 normal states and 1 bad state.  Each normal
state has transitions to and from the bad state.  Otherwise the only
transitions are from a normal state to itself and to its successor.
The successor of state 19 is state 0, so the normal states progress
monotonically around a loop.

My first output model was Gaussian with the mean for state $s$ given
in terms of the mean and rms deviation of the previous thousand
observations, the previous observation and a fixed offset, with
\begin{align*}
  s &= \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{\tau=1,000}^{\tau=1} y[t-\tau]^2}{1,000}} \\
  m &=  \frac{\sum_{\tau=1,000}^{\tau=1} y[t-\tau]}{1,000} \\
  \mu[t,i](y[:t]) &= a[i,0] \cdot s + a[i,1] \cdot m + a[i,2] \cdot
  y[t-1] + a[i,3]
\end{align*}

Viterbi decoding with such a model after training for 20 iterations on
record \emph{a01} yields Figure~\ref{fig:modelAR1k20}

      output model that uses the previous 1,000 observations to
      characterize the mean and variance of the signal.  An ECG trace
      appears in the upper plot, while the decoded state sequence
      appears in the lower plot.  The model was fit using 30
      iterations of the Baum Welch algorithm.}

A simple linear auto-regressive model with
\begin{equation*}
  \mu[t,i] = a[i,0] \cdot y[t-1] + a[i,1] \cdot y[t-2] + a[i,2] \cdot
  y[t-2]  + a[i,3]
\end{equation*}
similarly yields Figure~\ref{fig:modelAR3_20}.

    \caption{Model for this figure differs from the one used for
      Fig.~\ref{fig:modelAR1k20} by using an affine function of only
      the three previous samples to calculate the forecast mean.  The
      model has 20 states.}

    \caption{The model for this figure has 301 states.  The states

      monotonically.  State 300 is reserved for atypical data.}

    \caption{This figure displays a later segment of the data.  It is
      based on the same model as Fig.~\ref{fig:modelAR3_300}.  The time
      between beats corresponds to a pulse of less than 50 bpm, and the
      model looses synchronization and puts in extra beats.  The stock
      analyzer also puts in extra beats when the heart rate drops
      below 40 bpm.}

    \caption{This model is like the one for
      Fig.~\ref{fig:modelAR3_300_double} but there are transitions
      from each normal state to itself.  The model doesn't insert
      extra beats, but it does use state 300 for data that seems
      typical.}
