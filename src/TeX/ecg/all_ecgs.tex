\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The data for the \emph{Computers in Cardiology Challenge} in 2000,
CINC2000, consists of ECG recordings of 70 patients in sleep studies.
The challenge (see https://archive.physionet.org/challenge/2000/) was
to ``demonstrate the efficacy of ECG-based methods for apnea detection
using a large, well-characterized, and representative set of data.''

I am reworking an approach to the challenge, and I don't understand
why the ECG waveforms in some of the records are so different from the
others.  I suspect that lead placement caused much of the variation.
However, I also suspect that a few of the records show pathologies in
addition to apnea.  I would like to talk to an expert about the
variations.

In Section~\ref{sec:strange_records} I have a few notes on
peculiarities I see in some of the records, and in
Section~\ref{sec:all_records} I have plots of a few seconds of each
record.

\section{Strange Records}
\label{sec:strange_records}

\begin{description}
\item[a02] Small R wave.  Looking at other times, I see that the wave
  forms are different.  There are changes at 129.2, 175.8, 188.1,
  206.8, etc.  Maybe the patient is moving?
\item[a10] Inverted signal?
\item[a12] Small inverted signal?
\item[a20] Double R wave.  Same double pattern throughout the record.
  I think it's a characteristic of the patient.
\item[c02] Negative R wave?
\item[x05] S bigger than R
\item[x06] S bigger than R
\item[x17] Strange waveform.  I think T is the biggest feature.  Bad
  lead placement?
\item[x24] S bigger than R ?
\item[x33] Small inverted signal
\item[x34] Same as x33
