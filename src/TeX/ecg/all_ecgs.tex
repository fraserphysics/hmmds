\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The data for the \emph{Computers in Cardiology Challenge} in 2000,
CINC2000, consists of ECG recordings of 69 patients in sleep studies.
The challenge (see https://archive.physionet.org/challenge/2000/) was
to ``demonstrate the efficacy of ECG-based methods for apnea detection
using a large, well-characterized, and representative set of data.''

I am reworking an approach to the challenge, and I don't understand
why the ECG waveforms in some of the records are so different from the
others.  I suspect that lead placement caused much of the variation.
However, I also suspect that a few of the records show pathologies in
addition to apnea.  I would like to talk to an expert about the
variations.

In Section~\ref{sec:strange_records} I have a few notes on
peculiarities I see in some of the records, and in
Section~\ref{sec:all_records} I have plots of a few seconds of each
record.

\section{Strange Records}
\label{sec:strange_records}

\begin{description}
\item[a02] Small R wave.  See Figure~\ref{fig:ecgs_a01}.  There are
  changes at minutes 129.2, 175.8, 188.1, 206.8, etc.  Maybe the
  patient is moving?
\item[a10] Inverted signal?  See Figure~\ref{fig:ecgs_a07}.
\item[a12] Small inverted signal?  See Figure~\ref{fig:ecgs_a07}.
\item[a20] Double R wave.  Same double pattern throughout the record.
  I think it's a characteristic of the patient.  See
  Figure~\ref{fig:ecgs_a19}.
\item[c02] Negative R wave?  See Figure~\ref{fig:ecgs_c01}.
\item[c05] I think this is the same as c06.  Peak at minute 9.235 in
  c05 is the same as peak at 10.569 in c06.
\item[x05] S bigger than R.  See Figure~\ref{fig:ecgs_x03}.
\item[x06] S bigger than R.  See Figure~\ref{fig:ecgs_x03}.
\item[x11] Atypical beats.  See Figure~\ref{fig:x11_332.83}.  See
  Figure~\ref{fig:ecgs_x09}.
\item[x13] Occasional big negative spikes.  See Figure~\ref{fig:x13_165.5}
\item[x17] Strange waveform.  I think T is the biggest feature.  Bad
  lead placement?  See Figure~\ref{fig:ecgs_x15}.
\item[x24] S bigger than R ?  See Figure~\ref{fig:ecgs_x21}.
\item[x26] What's happening at minutes 65.8 and 65.95 (1:05:47.5,
  1:05:55 and 1:05:57 in Figure~\ref{fig:x26_65.78})?
\item[x29] Frequent short inter-beat intervals.  See
  Figure~\ref{fig:x29_328.95}.  Except minutes 296 to 317 are normal.
\item[x33] Small inverted signal.  See Figure~\ref{fig:ecgs_x33}.
\item[x34] Same as x33
