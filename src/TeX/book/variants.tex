\chapter{Variants and Generalizations}
\label{chap:variants}

Hidden Markov models are special cases of discrete time state space
models characterized by a state transition probability function and an
observation probability function, \ie,
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:ssm}
  \begin{align}
      &P(\State_{n+1}|\State_n)\text{, and }\\
      &P(\Output_n|\State_n).
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
In Chapter~\ref{chap:algorithms} we described algorithms for fitting
and using the probability distributions specified in
Eqn.~\eqref{eq:ssm} if both the set of possible states $\states$ and
the set of possible observations $\outputs$ have an unstructured
finite number of discrete values.  However, in many applications the
measurements, and perhaps the states also, are thought of as being
drawn from continuous vector spaces.

Since most experimental observations are measured and recorded
digitally, one could argue that discrete approximations are adequate
and attempt to use the algorithms of Chapter~\ref{chap:algorithms}
anyway.  That approach is disastrous because it precludes exploiting
either the metric or topological properties of the space of
measurements.  Consider the histogram of the first 600 samples of
Tang's laser data in Fig.~\ref{fig:LaserHist}.  Neither 5 nor 93
occurs, but it seems more plausible that 93 will occur in the
remainder of the samples because there are 14 occurrences between 90
and 96 and none between 2 and 8.  To make more effective use of
measured data, one usually approximates the probabilities by functions
with a small number of free parameters.  For many such families of
\emph{parametric models} one can use the algorithms of
Chapter~\ref{chap:algorithms} with minor modifications\footnote{At the
  1988 ICASSP meeting, Poritz\cite{Poritz88} reviewed several HMM
  variants.}.  For a practitioner, the challenge is to find or develop
both, a parametric family that closely matches the measured system,
and algorithms for fitting and using the models.

    nor $y=93$ occurs in $\ts{y}{1}{600}$, it is more plausible that
    $y=93$ would occur in future measurements because of what happens
    in the neighborhood.  Discarding the numerical significance of the
    bin labels would preclude such an observation. }

In this chapter we will describe some model families with Gaussian
observations.  We will use the failure of the maximum likelihood
approach with such models to motivate and develop
\emph{\index*{regularization}}.  Also, we will touch on the
relationships between HMM model families and other kinds of models.

\subsection{Independent Scalar Observations}
\label{sec:ScalarGaussian}

A simple model for continuously distributed measurements is an HMM
with an independent scalar Gaussian observation model associated with each
state.  In many cases it is adequate, but risky (See
Fig.~\ref{fig:MLEfail}), to simply use the algorithms of
Chapter~\ref{chap:algorithms} with minor modifications for Gaussian
observations.  Such algorithms performed satisfactorily for the exercises
depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:ScalarGaussian} in which we estimated an
approximate state sequence and model parameters from a sequence of
observations.

  and starting from Eqn.~\eqref{eq:Qout1} calculate

  \sum_{\ts{q}{1}{T}:\ti{q}{t}=s }P_{\parameters}
  \left(\ts{q}{1}{T}|\ts{y}{1}{T} \right) \\

    \log(2\pi) + \log(\sigma_s) + \frac{\left( \ti{y}{t}-\mu_s
      \right)^2}{2\sigma_s^2} \right).

Since the formulas

  \mu_s &= \sum_{t=1}^T w(s,t) \ti{y}{t} \\
  \sigma_s^2 &= \sum_{t=1}^T w(s,t)\left( \ti{y}{t}-\mu_s \right)^2
\end{align}
maximize $Q_{\text{observation}} (\parameters',\parameters)$, we use them in place
of the discrete observation reestimation formula of
Chapter~\ref{chap:algorithms} (Table \ref{tab:reestimation} and
Eqn.~\eqref{eq:NewOut}).

\subsection{Singularities of the likelihood function and regularization}
\label{sec:regularization}

Running five iterations of the Baum Welch algorithm on the observation
sequence in Fig.~\ref{fig:ScalarGaussian}~(c) starting with the model
in Fig.~\ref{fig:MLEfail}~(a) produces the model in
Fig.~\ref{fig:MLEfail}~(b) in which the variance of the observations
produced by the second state looks suspiciously small.  In fact with
additional iterations of the Baum Welch algorithm that variance
continues to shrink, and after the seventh iteration, our code stops
with a floating point exception.  The algorithm is pursuing a
singularity in the likelihood function in which the second state fits
the $56^{\text{th}}$ observation exactly and the first state fits all
of the other observations.  If $\mu_2 = \ti{y}{56}$ the likelihood
$P_{\ti{Y}{t}|\ti{S}{t}} \left(\ti{y}{56}|2 \right)$ increases without
limit as $\sigma_2 \rightarrow 0$, \ie,
\begin{equation*}
  \lim_{\sigma_2 \rightarrow 0} P_{\ti{Y}{t}|\ti{S}{t}}
  \left(\ti{y}{56}|2 \right) = \infty.
\end{equation*}

  {An illustration of trouble with maximum likelihood.  Here we have

    above.  Five iterations of the algorithm produced the suspicious
    model depicted in (b) above.}

Such singularities of likelihood are common among parametric
probability density functions.  A particularly simple example is the
\emph{Gaussian mixture model}\index{Gaussian mixture model|textbf}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:GaussianMixture}
  f(y) = \lambda \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma_1^2}}
  e^{-\frac{(y-\mu_1)^2}{2 \sigma_1^2}} + (1-\lambda) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma_2^2}}
  e^{-\frac{(y-\mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}},
\end{equation}
which has the five parameters $\mu_1,~\sigma_1,~\mu_2,~\sigma_2,$ and $\lambda$.
Assuming that the data are \iid, one might attempt a maximum
likelihood fit to the observations in
Fig.~\ref{fig:ScalarGaussian}~(e) with the likelihood function
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:GMLike}
  g(\mu_1,\sigma_1,\mu_2,\sigma_2,\lambda) = \prod_{t=1}^T f(\ti{y}{t}).
\end{equation}
While it is possible to find a useful \emph{local} maximum of $g$
near
\begin{equation*}
  \mu_1 = -1,~~\sigma_1 = 1,~~ \mu_2 = 1,~~ \sigma_2 = 1,~~ \lambda =
  \frac{2}{3},
\end{equation*}
the likelihood is higher near the singularities of $g$ specified by
the equations
\begin{align*}
  \mu_s &= \ti{y}{t}\\
  \sigma_s &= 0,
\end{align*}
for each pair $(s,t)\in \left\{1,2\right\} \times \left\{ 1,2,\ldots,T
\right\}$.

If, as is the case here, we want to exclude parameter vectors for
which the likelihood function is larger than its value at the solution
we prefer, then likelihood doesn't really express our goal.
\emph{Regularization} refers to a variation on maximum likelihood
that more accurately reflects what we want.  In the next subsection,
we explain how to use Bayesian \emph{priors} to regularize
\emph{maximum a posteriori} parameter estimates.

\label{sec:EMMAP}

\index*{Bayesian estimation} starts by characterizing the
acceptability of models $P_{\Y|\parameters}$ in terms of a
\emph{prior} probability distribution $P_{\parameters}$.  Initial
observations $\y_e$, called \emph{evidence} or training data, modify
the prior through Bayes rule to yield the \emph{a posteriori}
distribution
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:posteriori}
  P(\parameters|\y_e) = \frac{P(\y_e,\parameters)}{P(\y_e)} =
  \frac{P(\y_e|\parameters)P(\parameters)}{\int P(\y_e|\parameters)P(\parameters)\,
  d\parameters},
\end{equation}
and the probability of future observations $\y_f$ is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:futureBayes}
  P(\y_f|\y_e) = \int  P(\y_f|\parameters) P(\parameters|\y_e)\, d\parameters.
\end{equation}
The parameter vector that maximizes the \emph{a posteriori}
\index{maximum a posteriori estimate} distribution,
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:MAPdefa}
    \parameters_{\text{MAP}} &\equiv \argmax_\parameters P(\parameters|\y_e) \\
    \label{eq:MAPdefb}
    &= \argmax_\parameters P(\parameters,\y_e),
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
is called the MAP estimate.  \index{MAP estimate|see{maximum a
    posteriori estimate}} Using $\parameters_{\text{MAP}}$ one may
approximate\footnote{Although it is every bit as reasonable to use the
  mean to characterize the \emph{a posteriori} distribution as it is to
  use the maximum, we prefer the maximum because changing from MLE to
  MAP requires only minor modifications to the Baum Welch algorithm.
  A strictly Bayesian approach would retain the entire \emph{a
    posteriori} distribution in parameter space rather than
  characterizing the distribution by a single point estimate.}
Eqn.~\eqref{eq:futureBayes} with $P\left( \y_f|\parameters_{
    \text{MAP} } \right)$.

A slight variation of the algebra in Section~\ref{sec:EM} produces an
EM algorithm for maximum \emph{a posteriori} estimation.  Dropping
the subscript on $\y_e$ if we replace the auxiliary function of
Eqn.~\eqref{eq:Qdef}, \ie,
\begin{equation*}
  Q_{\text{MLE}}(\parameters',\parameters) \equiv \EV_{P
    \left(\bS|\y,\parameters \right)} \left( \log P(\bS,\y|\parameters') \right),
\end{equation*}
with
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:QMAP}
  \begin{align}
  \label{eq:QMAPa}
    Q_{\text{MAP}}(\parameters',\parameters) &\equiv \EV_{P \left(\bS|\y,\parameters \right)}
    \left( \log P(\bS,\y,\parameters') \right) \\
  \label{eq:QMAPb}
    &= Q_{\text{MLE}}(\parameters',\parameters) + \EV_{P \left(\bS|\y,\parameters
      \right)} \left( \log P(\parameters')\right) \\
  \label{eq:QMAPc}
    &= Q_{\text{MLE}}(\parameters',\parameters) + \log P(\parameters'),
  \end{align} 
\end{subequations}
then the derivation of
\begin{equation*}
    Q_{\text{MAP}}(\parameters',\parameters) > Q_{\text{MAP}}(\parameters,\parameters)
    \Rightarrow P(\y,\parameters') > P(\y,\parameters),
\end{equation*}
is completely parallel to the argument on page \pageref{eq:GEMcond}
that concludes $Q_{\text{MLE}}(\parameters',\parameters) >
Q_{\text{MLE}}(\parameters,\parameters)$.  If in addition the
components of $P(\parameters)$ are independent, \ie,
\begin{equation*}
  P(\parameters) = P(\parameters_{\text{initial}}) \cdot
  P(\parameters_{\text{transition}}) \cdot P(\parameters_{\text{observation}}),
\end{equation*}
then like the decomposition of $Q_{\text{MLE}}$ in
Eqn.~\eqref{eq:QHMMseparate} we find
\begin{equation*}
  Q_{\text{MAP}}(\parameters',\parameters) =  Q_{\text{MAP, initial}}
  (\parameters',\parameters) +   Q_{\text{MAP, transition}} (\parameters',\parameters)
  + Q_{\text{MAP, observation}}
  (\parameters',\parameters),
\end{equation*}
with
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:QseparateMAP}
  \begin{align}
    Q_{\text{MAP, initial}} &= Q_{\text{MLE, initial}} + \log
    P(\parameters_{\text{initial}}) \\
    Q_{\text{MAP, transition}} &= Q_{\text{MLE, transition}} + \log
    P(\parameters_{\text{transition}}) \\
    \label{eq:QseparateMAPout}
    Q_{\text{MAP, observation}} &= Q_{\text{MLE, observation}} + \log
    P(\parameters_{\text{observation}}).
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
With a suitable prior, the simple form of Eqn.~\eqref{eq:QseparateMAP}
makes it easy to convert a program that implements the Baum Welch
algorithm for \index{maximum likelihood estimate} maximum likelihood
estimation into a program that implements maximum a posteriori
estimation.

\subsection{Vector Autoregressive Observations}
\label{sec:ARVGaussian}

\subsubsection{Overview of the model}

Rather than choosing a prior and developing algorithms for the
independent scalar observations of Section~\ref{sec:ScalarGaussian} we will
work on more general models with vector autoregressive Gaussian
observations associated with each hidden state.  If at time $t$ such a
system is in state $s$, then the mean of the conditional distribution
for $\ti{y}{t}$ is a linear function of the $d$ previous observations
$\ts{y}{t-d}{t-1}$ added to a fixed offset.  Specifically, the
conditional distributions for observations are $n$ dimensional vector
Gaussians as follows:
\begin{description}
\item[Covariance] The covariance is a state dependent positive
  definite $n\times n$ matrix $\Sigma_s$.
\item[Mean] Given that the system is in state $s$, the parameters
  $\left\{ c_{s,i,\tau,j}, \bar y_{s,i} \right\}$ and the $d$ previous
  observations determine the mean of the observation distribution
  through an \emph{affine} function, \ie, the sum of a linear function
  and a fixed offset, with components
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ARVGout1}
    \mu\left(s,\ts{y}{t-d}{t-1}\right) = \bar y_{s,i} + \sum_{\tau =
    1}^d \sum_{j=1}^n c_{s,i,\tau,j} \ti{y_j}{t-\tau}.
  \end{equation}
  We implement this as a \emph{linear} function of a \emph{context
    vector} $x$ consisting of $d$ previous observations and a constant
  one, \ie,
  \begin{align*}
    \ti{x}{t} & \equiv \left( \overrightarrow{\ti{y}{t-1}},
      \overrightarrow{\ti{y}{t-2}},\ldots
      \overrightarrow{\ti{y}{t-d}}, 1\right)\\
    & \equiv \left(\ti{y_1}{t-1}, \ti{y_2}{t-1}, \ldots,
      \ti{y_n}{t-1}, \ti{y_1}{t-2}, \ldots, \ti{y_n}{t-d}, 1 \right).
  \end{align*}
  Using notation in which the $i\th$ component of the observation
  $\tau$ time steps before time $t$ is $\ti{y_i}{t-\tau}$, the $k\th$
  component of the context at time $t$ is
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:context}
    \ti{x_{k}}{t} = \begin{cases} \ti{y_i}{t-\tau} & 1\leq \tau \leq d
    \\ 1 & \tau = d+1,~~ i = 1, \end{cases},
  \end{equation}
  where $k=d\cdot(\tau-1) + i$, and
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ARVGout2}
    \mu_s\left(s,\ts{y}{t-d}{t-1}\right) = A_s \ti{x}{t}
  \end{equation}
  where $A_s$ is an $n\times(nd+1)$ matrix consisting of $\left\{
    c_{s,i,\tau,j} \right\}$ and $\left\{ \bar y_{s,i} \right\}$.
\end{description}
Using this notation the model assumptions are (compare to
Eqns.~\eqref{eq:assume_markov} and \eqref{eq:assume_output} which
describe the assumptions for HMMs with discrete observations.) that
the states follow a Markov process and that the conditional
distribution of an observation given the state $s$ is Gaussian with
mean $A_s \ti{x}{t}$ and covariance $\Sigma_s$, \ie,
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:assume_markovVARG}
  P(\ti{s}{t+1}|\ts{s}{-\infty}{t},\ts{y}{-\infty}{t}) &= 
  P\left(\ti{s}{t+1}|\ti{s}{t}\right)\\
  \label{eq:assume_outputVARG}
  P(\ti{y}{t}|\ts{s}{-\infty}{t},\ts{y}{-\infty}{t-1}) &=
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (2 \pi)^n \left|\Sigma_{s(t)}\right|}}
    \exp\left({-\frac{1}{2} z_{s(t)}\transpose(t) \Sigma_{s(t)}^{-1}
    z_{s(t)}(t)} \right)
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation*}
z_k(t) \equiv y(t) - A_k x(t).  
\end{equation*}

The model accounts for relationships between an observation and its
predecessors two ways, first the observation at time $\ti{y}{t}$ is
related to the $d$ previous observations through the matrix $A_s$, and
it is also related to \emph{all} previous observations through the state $s$.

\subsubsection{Reestimation}

A derivation like the one leading to \eqref{eq:QoutG3} yields
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:QVARGmle1}
  Q_{\text{observation}} (\parameters',\parameters) =  \frac{1}{2}
      \sum_{s\in\states} \sum_{t=1}^T w(s,t) \left[ \log\left( \left|
      \Sigma_s^{-1} \right| \right) - n
      \log(2\pi) - z_s\transpose(t)
      \Sigma_s^{-1} z_s(t)\right].
\end{equation}
Hence each term in the sum over $s$ can be optimized separately.  One
can write code that maximizes $ \sum_{t=1}^T w(s,t) \left[ \log \left|
    \Sigma_s^{-1} \right| - z_s\transpose(t) \Sigma_s^{-1}
  z_s(t)\right]$ using operations on vectors and matrices as
follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a weighted \emph{context} matrix $X_s$ with columns
  $\ti{x}{t}\sqrt{w(s,t)}$, where $w(s,t) =
  P_{\ti{S}{t}|\ts{y}{1}{T}} \left(s|\ts{y}{1}{T} \right)$ and
  Eqn.~\eqref{eq:context} defines $\ti{x}{t}$.
\item Create a weighted \emph{observation} matrix $Y_s$ with columns
  $\ti{y}{t}\sqrt{w(s,t)}$.
\item \label{step:A} Solve
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:VARGnewA}
    A_s = \argmin_M \left|Y_s - MX_s \right|^2
  \end{equation}
  (We use singular value decomposition methods here because they are
  stable and make diagnosing problems easy.)
\item Calculate a matrix of residuals
  \begin{equation*}
    Z_s = Y_s - A_s X_s
  \end{equation*}
\item \label{step:cov} Calculate a new covariance matrix\footnote{One
    may derive this formula by differentiating the right-hand side of
    Eqn.~\ref{eq:QVARGmle1} with respect to the elements of
    $\Sigma_s^{-1}$ and setting the result equal to zero.  The key is
    the observation that for a positive definite matrix $M$,
  \begin{equation*}
    \frac{\partial \log \left| M \right|}{\partial m_{i,j}} =
    \left[M^{-1}\right]_{i,j},
  \end{equation*}
  i.e., the derivative of the log of the determinant with respect to the
  $i,j^{th}$ element of $M$ is the $i,j^{th}$ element of $M^{-1}$.
  
  Since the value of $A_s$ that minimizes $ \sum_{t=1}^T w(s,t) -
  z_s\transpose(t) \Sigma_s^{-1} z_s(t)$ is independent of
$\Sigma_s^{-1}$, it is correct to do step \ref{step:A} before step
\ref{step:cov}. }
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:VARGnewSigma}
    \Sigma_s = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^T w(s,t) z_s(t)
      z_s\transpose(t)}{\sum_{t=1}^T w(s,t)},
  \end{equation}
  using $Z_s Z_s\transpose = \sum_{t=1}^T w(s,t) z_s(t)
  z_s\transpose(t)$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Regularization}
\index{regularization}

As Eqn.~\eqref{eq:QseparateMAP} indicates, we can influence the a
posteriori distributions of the initial states, the transitions, and
the observations by our selection of the respective priors,
$P(\parameters_{\text{initial}})$, $P(\parameters_{\text{transition}})$, and
$P(\parameters_{\text{observation}})$.  Since singularities in the likelihood
are associated with singular covariance matrices $\Sigma_s$, the prior
for the covariance matrices is most urgent.

Following \cite{Gauvain94, Ormoneit95} we use inverse-\index*{Wishart
distributions} as priors for the inverse covariance matrices.  See
pages 150-155 of Schafer \cite{Schafer97} for a description of the
these distributions.  The inverse-Wishart prior has the following
probability density for an $n\times n$ inverse covariance matrix
\begin{equation*}
  P_{\text{IW}}(\Sigma^{-1}) \equiv C \left| \Sigma^{-1}
                    \right|^{\frac{m+n+1}{2}}
                    e^{-\frac{1}{2} {\bf tr}(\Lambda \Sigma^{-1})},
\end{equation*}
where $C$ is a normalization constant, $m$ is called the \emph{degrees
  of freedom}, and $\Lambda$ is called the \emph{scale}.  The mean and
the maximum of the inverse-Wishart are
\begin{align*}
  \EV \Sigma^{-1} &= \frac{1}{m-n-1} \Lambda^{-1}, \text{ and} \\
  \argmax P_{\text{IW}} \left( \Sigma^{-1} \right) &= \frac{1}{m+n+1}
  \Lambda^{-1}
\end{align*}
respectively.

Assuming neutral priors for the coefficient matrices $A_s$ and the
form
\begin{equation*}
  \Lambda = \beta \id,
\end{equation*}
we find
\begin{equation*}
  P(\parameters_y) \propto \prod_s \left| \Sigma_s^{-1}
                    \right|^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}
                    e^{-\frac{1}{2} {\bf tr}(\beta \Sigma_s^{-1})},
\end{equation*}
(where $\alpha = n+m+1$) and Eqn.~\ref{eq:QseparateMAPout} becomes
\begin{multline*}
  \label{eq:QVARG1}
  Q_{\text{observation}} = C + \sum_s \left( \frac{\alpha}{2}\log\left|
      \Sigma_s^{-1}\right| - \frac{1}{2} {\bf tr}(\beta
    \Sigma_s^{-1}) \right) \\
  + \frac{1}{2} \sum_s \sum_{t=1}^T w(s,t) \left[ \log \left|
      \Sigma_s^{-1} \right| - z_s\transpose(t) \Sigma_s^{-1} z_s(t)\right],
\end{multline*}
where $z_s(t) \equiv y(t) - A_s x(t)$ and $w(s,t)$ is the probability
of being in state $s$ at time $t$ given the data $\ts{y}{1}{T}$.
Reestimation of the regularized model is the same as reestimation for
the unregularized model except that Eqn.~\ref{eq:VARGnewSigma} is
replaced with
\begin{equation}\label{eq:NewSigma}
  \Sigma_s = \frac{\beta \id + \sum_{t=1}^T w(s,t) z_s(t)
    z_s\transpose(t)} {\alpha + \sum_{t=1}^T w(s,t)}.
\end{equation}
Thus in the absence of new information, a covariance matrix is given
the default value $\frac{\beta \id}{\alpha}$, and $\alpha$ is the
weight of that default.

\section{Related Models}
\label{sec:related}

Figure~\ref{fig:VARGstates} illustrates the strength of the HMMs with
vector autoregressive observations described in
Section~\ref{sec:ARVGaussian}, namely that optimization finds regions
over which dynamics are approximately linear and assigns those regions
to single states.  The model class used to make the figure does not
exploit all of the available features of the Lorenz data.  In
particular it does not use the Lorenz equations.  Modeling techniques
exist that can exploit knowledge of nonlinear generating equations,
\eg \emph{extended Kalman filters} and \emph{particle filters} that we
mention below.

  {Plots of decoded states using an HMM with vector autoregressive
    observations.  Here the observations are a trajectory of three
    dimensional state vectors from the Lorenz system.  In each state
    the observation $\ti{y}{t}$ is modeled as a Gaussian with a mean
    that is an affine (linear plus fixed offset) function of the
    observation $\ti{y}{t-1}$.  The empty boxes correspond to states
    that do not appear in the decoded sequence of states.  In
    comparing with Fig.~\ref{fig:Statesintro} which used a model with
    coarsely quantized observations, notice that large regions near
    the fixed points at centers of the spirals are represented by a
    single state.  These large regions occur because the dynamics are
    approximately linear over their extents.}

Here we list a few of the many techniques that are related to the
basic ideas we've described:
\begin{description}
\item[Nonstationary HMMs] The definition of a \emph{stationary} model
  is that all probabilities are independent of shifts in time, \ie, $
  P_{\ts{Y}{1}{t}} = P_{\ts{Y}{1+\tau}{t+\tau}} \forall (t,\tau).$
  Many processes, for example weather, are not even approximately
  stationary.  By making HMMs with state transition probabilities that
  depend on time, many have created nonstationary HMMs for such
  applications.  With Rechtsteiner\cite{Rechtsteiner2000} we have
  implemented weather models with transition probabilities that depend
  on the time of year.  In similar work, Hughes and
  Guttorp\cite{Hughes99} described a local precipitation model with
  state transition probabilities driven by large scale atmospheric
  parameters.
\item[Gaussian mixtures] In a Gaussian mixture, the probability
  density is weighted average of Gaussian densities.  We described a
  simple one dimensional two component example in
  Eqn.~\eqref{eq:GaussianMixture}.  Although a simple Gaussian mixture
  model does not use the notion of \emph{state}, they are frequently
  used as observation models in HMMs.  Note a Gaussian mixture model
  is equivalent to the degenerate case of an HMM with Gaussian
  observations in which all state transition probabilities are
  identical.
\item[Cluster weighted modeling] For an HMM, the state transition
  probabilities depend only on the state.  Looking at
  Fig.~\ref{fig:VARGstates}, it seems that letting the current
  observation $\ti{y}{t}$ influence the transition probabilities could
  be an improvement, \ie, the probability of the next state would
  depend on both the current state and the current observation.  By
  ignoring the current state entirely, one obtains a \emph{ cluster
    weighted model}\cite{Gershenfeld99}; the observation at time $t+1$
  is a mixture whose component weights are determined by the
  observation at time $t$.
\item[Kalman filter] The Kalman filter is essentially the forward
  algorithm applied to a model with continuous states $\ti{x}{t}$ and
  observations $\ti{y}{t}$ with the form
  \begin{align*}
    \ti{x}{t+1} &= F(\ti{x}{t},t) + \ti{\eta}{t}\\
    \ti{y}{t} &= G(\ti{x}{t}) + \ti{\epsilon}{t}
  \end{align*}
  where the functions $F$ and $G$ are linear in $x$ and the noise
  terms $\ti{\eta}{t}$ and $\ti{\epsilon}{t}$ are Gaussian.  We will
  describe algorithms that operate with such models in the next
  chapter.
\item[Extended Kalman filter] Using linear approximations to nonlinear
  functions $F$ and $G$ in a Kalman filter is called an \emph{extended
  Kalman filter}.  Linear approximations work well as long as the
  covariance of the state distributions are small compared to the
  second derivatives of $F$ and $G$.
\item[Unscented Kalman filter] Rather than use linear approximations
  to $F$ and $G$, an unscented Kalman filter\cite{Julier97} uses exact
  functions and a collection of samples to estimate means and
  variances.
\item[Particle filter] The idea of using the empirical distribution of
  many simulated trajectories (particles) to approximate the
  conditional distribution $P_{\ti{X}{t}|\ts{Y}{1}{t}}$ is called
  particle filtering\cite{Gordon93,Kitagawa96}.  In the procedure,
  particles that seem inconsistent with measurements are eliminated
  and new particles are created.
