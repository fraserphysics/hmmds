abstract = {Lyapunov exponents give a way to capture the central features of chaos and of stability in both deterministic and stochastic systems using just a few real numbers. However, exact analytic determination of Lyapunov exponents is rarely possible, and as we will show, even an accurate numerical computation is not a trivial task. One of the principal results of this thesis is about random Fibonacci sequences. Random Fibonacci sequences are defined by $tsb1=tsb2=1$ and $tsb{n}={pm}tsb{n-1}pm tsb{n-2}$ for $n>2,$ where each $pm$ sign is independent and either + or $-$ with probability 1/2. Using Stern-Brocot sequences, we prove that$${root nof{vert tsb{n}vert}}to1.13198824... {rm as} ntoinfty$$with probability 1.Other contributions of this thesis include formulas for condition numbers of random triangular matrices and an accurate computation of the Lyapunov exponents of the Lorenz equations.},
