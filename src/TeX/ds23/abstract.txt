I describe hidden Markov models with discreet states and
autoregressive observation functions that I have built to model
electrocardiogram data and the use of those models for data
assimilation.  My ultimate goal is to detect obstructive sleep apnea
based on ECG measurements alone.  Here I describe the intermediate
processes of estimating the timing of the individual PQRST phases of
each heart beat and obtaining from those times estimates of time series of
heart rate.  My model exploits the observation that variations in
heart rate affect the time between PQRST sequences, but that the
duration of the PQRST sequences do not change.
