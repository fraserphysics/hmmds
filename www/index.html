Hidden Markov Models and Dynamical Systems<br>

<br>
In 2017, I returned to the task of rewriting the code for my
book <em>Hidden Markov Models and Dynamical Systems</em>, which
is <a href="http://www.ec-securehost.com/SIAM/OT107.html">available
from SIAM</a>.  I am
using <a href="https://github.com/fraserphysics/hmmds">github</a> for
version control.

<br>
The new code will be superior to the code that I distributed here in
the past. It is easier to read, use and extend.  It's fast and has
better documentation.  However the new code does not exactly reproduce
the results in the book.  The differences are not due to errors, but
are due to different code, libraries and random number generators.<br>

<br>
Click <a href="http://www.fraserphysics.com/~andy/hmmdsbook/old_hmmds_code.tar.bz2">here
for a tar file of the old code</a>.  The code no longer builds on my
computers.  While I should have maintained the code over the years, I
will now concentrate on the new code instead of supporting the old
code.<br>
